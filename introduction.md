# Abstract

Sea Spray Aerosol \(SSA\) is generated by the bubble bursting of whitecap waves occurring in the sea surface microlayer \(SSML\), i.e. on the top layer of 1~1000 Âµm of seawater \([Michaud et al., 2018](http://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04409-z)\). It contains mixed salts, organic materials, and marine biogenic. With 71% ocean coverage of the Earth, SSA represents as a major atmospheric aerosol particle type, and an essential source of human inhalable particles in the coastal area. Since the coastal zone \(~100 km to the coastline\) supports a population that is three times denser than the global average \([Crossland et al. 2005](http://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-27851-6_1)\), characterization of the concentration of bioactive ingredients in SSA, the aging and spreading of SSA particles, and the human health effects of bioactive ingredients in SSA are vital for understanding and evaluating the human health consequences of SSA.

We have designed the following long-term sampling survey along with lab simulation experiments to \(1\) reveal the formation mechanism of human health-related compounds in SSA, \(2\) investigate the aging and transmission pattern of SSA bioactive particles, and \(3\) hopefully predict the SSA-Human-Health-Index through conventional monitoring methods.
