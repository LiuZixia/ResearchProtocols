# 1.1.3.Wind Speed and Direction

Wind speed and direction should be measured with [WeatherFlow WINDmeter](https://weatherflow.com/weather-meter/). Measurement should be performed three times: before, during, and after the sampling process. Both average speed and gust speed should be recorded. See [HERE](https://help.weatherflow.com/hc/en-us/articles/207905908-WEATHERmeter-User-Guide) for the device user guide
