# 2.2.1.1.qPCR with Seawater Sample

#### **Sapmle Preparation**

Seawater samples collected according to [Protocol 1.2.2](../../../field-sampling/2/2.md) can be used for phytoplankton community analysis. At least 200ml of each sample is needed for this analysis to perform, assuming the abundance of phytoplankton in seawater sample is higher than 10^4 cell per liter.

Before analysis, all samples should be prepared according to the following procedures: 

1. Fix the seawater samples with 0.4% \(v/v\) Lugol’s solution right after the samples collected from field.
2. Centrifuge the fixed seawater samples at 4000g for 10min, discard the supernatant.
3. Wash the sample pellets in 500 ml PBS buffer.
4. Centrifuge the samples again at 4000g for 10min, discard the supernatant.
5. Store the sample pellets at −20°C.

#### **Equipment**

* High-speed centrifuge

#### Cell Counts

A 1.0 ml aliquot from each seawater sample will be counted using a cell counting chamber, the total number of cells within each sample can be estimated.

#### DNA Extraction

#### PCR Primer Selection
