# 2.2.1.1.qPCR with Seawater Sample

#### **Sapmle Preparation**

Seawater samples collected according to [Protocol 1.2.2](../../../field-sampling/1.2.water-samping/1.2.2.surface-seawater-sampling.md) can be used for phytoplankton community analysis.

Fix the seawater sample with 0.4% \(v/v\) Lugol’s solution right after the samples collected from field. At least 200ml of each sample is needed for this analysis to perform, assuming the abundance of phytoplankton in seawater sample is higher than 10^4 cell per liter. 

Before analysis, all samples should be centrifuged at 3500g for 15min, discard the supernatant, and store the pellet at −20°C.

#### **Equipment**

* High-speed centrifuge

#### DNA Extraction
