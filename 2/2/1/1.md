# 2.2.1.1.Sapmle Preparation

Seawater samples collected according to [Protocol 1.2.2](../../../1/2/2.md) can be used for phytoplankton community analysis. At least 500ml of each sample is needed for this analysis to perform, assuming the abundance of phytoplankton in seawater sample is higher than 10^4 cell per liter.

Before analysis, all samples should be prepared according to the following procedures: 

1. Fix the seawater samples with 0.4% \(v/v\) Lugol’s solution right after the samples collected from field.
2. Filter the fixed seawater samples with 100µm sieves and then 5µm filters.
3. Rinse the 100µm sieves with 50ml 0.4% \(v/v\) Lugol’s solution.
4. Store the 5µm filter and rinsed water samples at −20°C.
